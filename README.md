# Storm-Events-Project
The goal of this project is to investigate the socioeconomic damages due to extreme events in the USA. Quantifying the relationships between the socioeconomic damages and its influencing factors such as the climate extreme events will enable better estimation of future potential losses/costs. The key steps of this investigation are:  Identification of key climate-related statistic from the historical data. These include multivariate events such as floods, droughts, heat index, sustained wind speed, wind-induced peak sea level surge, fires, etc. Development of a stochastic modeling strategy that accounts for correlations across multiple events and multiple locations and simulates risk under changing climate conditions at different scales. Both parametric and non-parametric methods will be used with full uncertainty analysis. Perform a detailed investigation of the impacts of extremes on the key vulnerable sectors. The NOAA storm events database that contains continental scale records of the occurrence of storms (from 1950 - present) and other significant weather phenomena will be used as the baseline for this. Realistic influence diagrams that replicate decision-making and opportunities for action to mitigate risk under climate information will be developed from this historical impacts data.
